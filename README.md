- 👋 Hello and welcome to my Github profile!

My name is Cem Emir Senyurt, and I am a highly motivated and dedicated computer science student with a passion for solving complex problems through innovative technology solutions. Originally from Istanbul, Turkey, I moved to San Francisco in 2017 to pursue my education and explore the opportunities that the Silicon Valley has to offer.

As a student at the College of San Mateo, I discovered my passion for computer science and dedicated myself to learning programming languages, despite having no prior experience in the field. I quickly excelled in my studies, achieving a 3.93 GPA and earning a place in the Phi Theta Kappa Honor Society, which is the international honor society for two-year colleges and academic programs.

Currently, I am studying Computer Science at the University of California Irvine, where I am eager to further expand my knowledge and skill set. I am actively seeking internships to gain practical experience and apply my academic knowledge to real-world projects. My ultimate goal is to pursue a master's degree in Computer Science and become a highly skilled and respected software developer.

In addition to my academic pursuits, I am also a social and outgoing person who enjoys spending time with friends and family, playing guitar, and working out at the gym. I am also an avid sports fan and history buff, which has helped me develop strong analytical skills and attention to detail, which are essential for success in the tech industry.

Thank you for taking the time to learn more about me. I look forward to connecting with other tech professionals and contributing to the open-source community through my Github projects.
