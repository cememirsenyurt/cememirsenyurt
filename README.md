EXPERIENCE
â€¢ Undergraduate Researcher at University of California Irvine
Start Date: 09/22/2022 â€“ Currently Working
About: I am currently working as an undergrad researcher at The Games, Optimization, Algorithms, and Learning Lab (GoalLab) in UCI. We study theory of machine learning and its interface with learning in games and algorithmic game theory, optimization, dynamical systems, probability, and statistics. Every week, a graduate student explains a topic from a scholar research paper, and I am working on the implementation side (in Python) of those papers.
TECHNICAL SKILLS
â€¢ Programming Languages: Python, C++, C, Java, Assembly Language (MIPS), MySQL, PostgreSQL, NoSQL, R.
â€¢ Additional Skills: Git, numpy.py, matplotlib.py, pandas.py, pyro, Pytorch, TensorFlow, Artificial Intelligence, Machine Learning and Data Mining.
â€¢ Community Skills: Respect, Leadership, Teamwork, Time management, Attention to detail, Communication, High Productivity in pressure, Stress Management, Quick adaptation to any environment.
PROJECTS
C++ / Python Projects:
â€¢ Search Engine: In this project me and my team developed 3 separate programs: web crawler with given file of domains and documents, an indexer, and a search component. We used technologies like BeautifulSoup, nltk, PorterStemmer for getting appropriate tokens from files. We used JSON to take care of the Dictionary look-like given documents and URLâ€™s. Lastly, we created a front-end user interface with React on Flask.
â€¢ Base GPS System for Airports: This project is implementing a program that calculates the distance between locations on the surface of the Earth with given latitudes and longitudes. Within given airports, it finds the farthest, closest, and the middle airport among them. I gain a big experience in C++ Standard Library.
â€¢ Login System: This project was implemented to provide an internet service. It is authentication service that manages usernames and passwords as well as an email login system. I completely observed the idea of the "well-behaved classes". Also, we used Hash-Map to implement this system.
â€¢ Terminal-based Text Editor: This project implemented a terminal-based text editor in C++. Our text editor has some key features that editors like vim, emacs, or nano has but little bit simpler. It has properties like, cursor displays the current position where we're editing, cursor can be moved around within the text using the keyboard, text typed into the editor is inserted at the point where we typed it, text can be deleted using a "backspace" key on the keyboard, and every change made in the editor can be undone with one keypress and can be redone after being undone. Undo and redo are implemented with Stacks.
â€¢ Recursive Depth-First, Breadth-First Search Maze Solver: This project implements a two-dimensional maze of arbitrary size, with a C++ class that can solve this maze. The goal was to understand of how to use recursion to solve real problems with the depth-first algorithm.
â€¢ Checkout System for Retail Stores: In this project, I wrote a simulation of a retail store which is considering a rearrangement of their system where their customers go through the check-out process, more efficiently. While doing that, I implemented a Doubly Linked List with head and tail pointers, then use it as the basis for a queue.
â€¢ Othello game Artificial Intelligence: This project handles the idea of the Artificial Intelligence (AI) which plays the game called "Othello" against "Human Users", or against other AIs. I used search trees and traverse tree-based structures with implementing complex recursive algorithm.
Java Projects:
â€¢ Course Registration Project: Wrote a waitlist system for students to be used as part of a school registration system.
â€¢ Insurance Claims Bar Chart: JavaFX compiling process to display the number of disability insurance claims paid by the month.
â€¢ Rectangle Drawing GUI: Created a JavaFX GUI application for drawing rectangles using JavaFX (without SceneBuilder).
â€¢ Raffle Ticket Assignment: Wrote a complete program randomly choose three unique winning ticket numbers within range.
