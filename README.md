# 👋 Hello and welcome to my GitHub!

I’m **Cem Emir Senyurt**, a software engineer and AI builder in the Bay Area. I recently completed my **B.S. in Computer Science (UC Irvine)** and **M.S. in Software Engineering (Carnegie Mellon University)**.

I like owning ambiguous problems end to end: turning messy inputs into reliable systems, shipping fast, and measuring outcomes.
